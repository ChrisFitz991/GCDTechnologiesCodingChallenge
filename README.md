# GCDTechnologiesCodingChallenge

This my C# Console Application for tracking To Do List Items.
The application will allow the user to enter a number of items into the application. They will then be able to go back and update the data to say if the task has been completed. At any point the user can view all information stored by the application.

If I was to complete the application over a longer time period I would have made the application more visual either through creating a mobile app or windows form applicaiton. With the longer time scale i would also have developed a database to store and retain the information even when the application is closed. Another feature I would like to have tried to impliment would have been a Time and Date feature. Meaning the user can set different tasks for different days and also allocate different times to complete each task for. This means features like 'Upcomming Tasks' or 'Tomorrows Tasks' could have been implimented into the application.

Overall I feel the simple applicaiton I have created meets the requirements set but has room for imporvement.
